# Contributing Guide

Iâ€™m really excited that you are interested in contributing to this project. Before submitting your contribution though, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines.

- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines
- The issue list of this repo is <strong>exclusively</strong> for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.
- Try to search for your issue, it may have been answered.
- See if the error is reproduceable with the latest version.
- **Never** comment "+1" or "me too!" on issues without leaving additional information, use the :+1: button in the top right instead.

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Always work on a new branch. Making changes on your fork's `dev` or `master` branch can cause problems. (See [Help beginners to contribute to open source projects](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions))
- Bug fixes should be submitted to the `master` branch.
- New features and breaking changes should be submitted to the `dev` branch.
- Use a descriptive title no more than 64 characters long. This will be used as the commit message when your PR is merged.
- For changes and feature requests, please include an example of what you are trying to solve and an example of the markup. It is preferred that you create an issue first however, as that will allow to review your proposal before you start.
- Please reference the issue # that the PR resolves, something like `Fixes #xxx[,#xxx]` or `Resolves #xxx[,#xxx]` (See [closing issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/))
